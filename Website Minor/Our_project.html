        <h2>What is Monte Carlo simulation?</h2>
        <p>
          Monte Carlo Simulation, also known as the Monte Carlo Method or a
          multiple probability simulation, is a mathematical technique, which is
          used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event. The
          Monte Carlo Method was invented by John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam
          during World War II to improve decision making under uncertain
          conditions. It was named after a well-known casino town, called
          Monaco, since the element of chance is core to the modeling approach,
          similar to a game of roulette.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since its introduction, Monte Carlo Simulations have assessed the
          impact of risk in many real-life scenarios, such as in artificial
          intelligence, stock prices, sales forecasting, project management, and
          pricing. They also provide a number of advantages over predictive
          models with fixed inputs, such as the ability to conduct sensitivity
          analysis or calculate the correlation of inputs. Sensitivity analysis
          allows decision-makers to see the impact of individual inputs on a
          given outcome and correlation allows them to understand relationships
          between any input variables.

        <h2>How does Monte Carlo simulation work?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike a normal forecasting model, Monte Carlo Simulation predicts a
          set of outcomes based on an estimated range of values versus a set of
          fixed input values. In other words, a Monte Carlo Simulation builds a
          model of possible results by leveraging a probability distribution,
          such as a uniform or normal distribution, for any variable that has
          inherent uncertainty. It, then, recalculates the results over and
          over, each time using a different set of random numbers between the
          minimum and maximum values. In a typical Monte Carlo experiment, this
          exercise can be repeated thousands of times to produce a large number
          of likely outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monte Carlo Simulations are also utilized for long-term predictions
          due to their accuracy. As the number of inputs increase, the number of
          forecasts also grows, allowing you to project outcomes farther out in
          time with more accuracy. When a Monte Carlo Simulation is complete, it
          yields a range of possible outcomes with the probability of each
          result occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
          One simple example of a Monte Carlo Simulation is to consider
          calculating the probability of rolling two standard dice. There are 36
          combinations of dice rolls. Based on this, you can manually compute
          the probability of a particular outcome. Using a Monte Carlo
          Simulation, you can simulate rolling the dice 10,000 times (or more)
          to achieve more accurate predictions.

        <h2>How to use Monte Carlo methods</h2>
        <p>
          Regardless of what tool you use, Monte Carlo techniques involves three
          basic steps: Set up the predictive model, identifying both the
          dependent variable to be predicted and the independent variables (also
          known as the input, risk or predictor variables) that will drive the
          prediction .
        </p>
        <p>
          Specify probability distributions of the independent variables. Use
          historical data and/or the analyst’s subjective judgment to define a
          range of likely values and assign probability weights for each.
        </p>
        <p>
          Run simulations repeatedly, generating random values of the
          independent variables. Do this until enough results are gathered to
          make up a representative sample of the near infinite number of
          possible combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can run as many Monte Carlo Simulations as you wish by modifying
          the underlying parameters you use to simulate the data. However,
          you’ll also want to compute the range of variation within a sample by
          calculating the variance and standard deviation, which are commonly
          used measures of spread. Variance of given variable is the expected
          value of the squared difference between the variable and its expected
          value. Standard deviation is the square root of variance. Typically,
          smaller variances are considered better.
